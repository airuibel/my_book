### Feature descriptions 

- Id [用户id]
  - Player’s Id
- groupId [所处小队id]
  - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.
- matchId [该场比赛id]
  - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.
- assists [助攻数]
  - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.
- boosts [使用能量,道具数量]
  - Number of boost items used.
- damageDealt [总伤害]

- headshotKills [爆头数]
  - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.

- killPlace [本厂比赛杀敌排行]
  - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.
- killPoints [Elo杀敌排名]
  - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.
- kills [杀敌数]
  - Number of enemy players killed.
- killStreaks [连续杀敌数]
  - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.
- longestKill [最远杀敌距离]
  - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.
- matchDuration [比赛时长] 
  - Duration of match in seconds.
- matchType [比赛类型(小组人数)]
  - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.
- maxPlace [本局最差名次]
  - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.
- numGroups [小组数量]
  - Number of groups we have data for in the match.
- rankPoints [Elo排名]
  - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.
- revives [救活队员的次数]
  - Number of times this player revived teammates.
- rideDistance [驾车距离]
  - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.
- roadKills [驾车杀敌数]
  - Number of kills while in a vehicle.

- weaponsAcquired [收集武器的数量]
  - Number of weapons picked up.
- winPoints [胜率Elo排名]
  - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.
- winPlacePerc [百分比排名]
  - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.
